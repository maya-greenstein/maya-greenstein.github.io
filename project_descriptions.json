  {"description": "For my undergraduate senior project, I selected to work on a project that US Nordic presented, requesting the development of a ski jump simulator. There were not many specific project requirements, simply a lack of reliable training methods, and the desire for a solution. We analyzed the forces ski jumpers experience whilst executing the jump and learned that the vast majority are in the body z-direction. This outcome allowed us to create a vertically moving platform to simulate the relative accelerations from the top of the ramp to landing. The main mechanical component was a platform that moved vertically by pneumatic actuators. We also provided visual cues via a VR headset to further simulate the real ski jump experience. As software lead, my main roles were to build a GUI to integrate the mechanical and visual cues and to contrive connection methods between components for a seamless user experience." },

  {"description": "Hi! I'm Maya! I'm an Aerospace Engineer with a BS and MS from CU Boulder. Since completing graduate school in 2024, I've been working at Wildfire Defense Systems as a computer scientist, focusing on projects ranging from wildfire risk modeling to Azure cloud-based devOps. I moved from New Jersey to Colorado in 2018 for school and am still in Denver now. Professionally, I’m trained as an aerospace engineer, but I excel in software-based roles and am passionate about making a positive impact through my work. Personally, I enjoy snowboarding, travelling, music, playing sports, and solving puzzles." }
