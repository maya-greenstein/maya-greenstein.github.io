  {"description": "Hi! I'm Maya! I'm an Aerospace Engineer with a BS and MS from CU Boulder. Since completing graduate school in 2024, I've been working for Wildfire Defense Systems as a computer scientist, working on projects ranging from wildfire risk model creation to Azure cloud based devOps. I moved from New Jersey to Colorado in 2018 for school and am still in Denver now. Professionally, I am trained as an Aersopace engineer, but I really excell within software based roles, and I am passionate about making a positive impact with the work that I do. Personally, I enjoy snowboarding, travelling, music, playing sports, and solving puzzles." }
