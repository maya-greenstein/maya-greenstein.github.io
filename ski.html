        <p class="description-small"><b style="font-size: 27px;">Description:</b> For my senior project, my team was approached by US Nordic requesting that we create a ski jump simulator. 
            There were not many guidelines, simply a problem that they had undreliable training methods. My team built a platform that was controlled by pnematic actuators
            that synced up with a VR headset displaying a ski jump. Analysis proved that most of the forces felt during a ski jump are in the body z direction, allowing a scaled version
            to be enacted by the lift.</p>

        <p class="some-text" style="color: white;">Abstract: </p>
        <p class="some-text" style="color: white;">Abstract: Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology has diverse applications, one notable exam- ple being its use in bathymetric mapping. When attempting to use bathymetric LiDAR for small object detection, it is imperative to minimize all possible sources of error to achieve the highest possible resolution. When a LiDAR system employs a scanning mechanism, as systems used for mapping typically do, one of these errors, referred to as a pointing error, comes from uncertainties in the direction in which the scanner is directing the laser beam during data collection. This thesis analyzes the mechanics and behavior of one such LiDAR system through the lens of previously defined assumptions about its behavior. The goal was to empirically and theoretically determine the pointing accuracy of this bathymetric LiDAR system. The desired specification for ground reso- lution accuracy for this system is 5cm. At a nominal flight altitude of 30m, this requires a pointing accuracy of less than 0.1◦. The system underwent multiple tests and processing algorithms to optimize its pointing capabilities. Results showed improvements in relative alignment of the data throughout capture, expected scanned object sizes, as well as an increased general understanding of the system’s pointing behavior. This paper also suggests possible mechanical solutions to enhance the system’s pointing capabilities further.</p>
